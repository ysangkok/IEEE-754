If you want to clone the analyzers, or just study the code, the following files
are provided here:

  README            This file
  License           MIT License file
  Makefile          To build btd and dtb
  btd.cpp           C++ binary to decimal converter
  dtb.cpp           C++ decimal to binary converter
  computeBin.php    AJAX server for dtb
  computeDec.php    AJAX server for btd
  analyzer.js       User Interactions
  numeric_value.js  Numeric calculations

  You will also need the index page for the analyzers (index.xhtml), plus the files in the css
  directory.

  You will need to install the GNU Multiprecision Library in order to build bdt
  and dtb.

  You will need a copy of jQuery for user interactions. The code on the web
  site uses JQuery version 1.7.1.
