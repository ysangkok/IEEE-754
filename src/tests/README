This directory contains programs that were used to verify some of the operations
of the IEEE-754 Analysis web page.

The to_binary code can be used to convert decimal values between 0 and 1 to
binary.

The floating-point_test and floating-point_analysis directories contain
partly-functional programs for generating values using the Standard C and Math
libraries; the floating-point_test code uses the fenv.h header to test the
"standard floating-point environment." Both these programs exposed limitations
in Binary128 support on the author's development system, and thus are incomplete
programs.

The java directory contains two Java programs that incorporate a small
floating-point value that was known to cause the Java compiler/runtime to loop
indefinitely. Referred to as DBL_MIN, the smallest "normalized" floating point
value represented using the Java double data type, 2.2250738585072012e-308 is
actually an approximation to the smallest "normal" Binary64 value. Our analyzer
says it's a subnormal and that the smallest normal (taken out to a few more
decimal places) is actually 2.225073858507201383090232717e-308. But even with
just 16 significant decimal digits, it is confusing why the value given should
be reported as "the problem." 2.2250738585072013e-308 is also a subnormal, one
digit closer to the smallest normal, and should have triggered the bug too.  But
it doesn't.
