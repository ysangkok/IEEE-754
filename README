This is the code for the “IEEE-754 Analyzers” web site hosted at
http://babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu/IEEE-754.

Originally created as a student project to parse floating-point numbers,
the code serves as a reference source for people who want to learn how
the IEEE-754 standard works and/or to verify the correctness of code
written for applications that work directly with floating-point values.

See the web site’s FAQ for details.
